# Brute-Force-Decryption
An encryption and brute-force decryption program for a cryptography course.

The program first asks for a paragraph of text which it will then encrypt. Then it will ask for the encrypted text, which it will attempt to decrypt via a brute-force method which uses the frequency of letters in the English language. Then the program will ask for the original text and decrypted text to compare how effective it was at deciphering the text. This program is more effective at deciphering larger files of text.
